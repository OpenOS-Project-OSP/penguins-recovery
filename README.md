# penguins-recovery

Unified Linux system recovery toolkit. Combines multiple recovery and rescue
projects into a modular architecture with pluggable builders and distro-family
adapters.

## Adapters (penguins-eggs naked ISO support)

The adapter system layers recovery tools onto any penguins-eggs naked ISO.
It auto-detects the distro family from `/etc/os-release` and uses the
appropriate package manager.

### Supported distro families

| Family | Package Manager | Distros |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Debian | apt | Debian, Ubuntu, Pop!_OS, Linux Mint, LMDE, Devuan, MX, Zorin, elementary |
| Fedora/RHEL | dnf/yum | Fedora, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, CentOS, Nobara |
| Arch | pacman | Arch, EndeavourOS, Manjaro, BigLinux, Garuda, CachyOS |
| SUSE | zypper | openSUSE Leap/Tumbleweed/Slowroll, SLES |
| Alpine | apk | Alpine Linux |
| Gentoo | emerge | Gentoo, Funtoo, Calculate |

### Usage

```bash
# Basic: layer recovery tools onto a naked ISO
sudo make adapt INPUT=naked-debian-bookworm-amd64.iso

# With custom output name
sudo make adapt INPUT=naked-arch-amd64.iso OUTPUT=recovery-arch.iso

# Include rescapp GUI wizard
sudo make adapt INPUT=naked-ubuntu-noble-amd64.iso RESCAPP=1

# Direct script usage
sudo ./adapters/adapter.sh --input naked.iso --output recovery.iso --with-rescapp

# From a URL
sudo ./adapters/adapter.sh --input https://sourceforge.net/.../naked-debian.iso
```

### How it works

1. Extracts the ISO and unsquashes the root filesystem
2. Detects the distro family from `/etc/os-release`
3. Installs recovery packages via the native package manager
4. Injects shared scripts, branding, and optionally rescapp
5. Repackages into a bootable hybrid ISO (BIOS + UEFI)

## Standalone Builders

| Builder | Base | Build Tool | Output | Source |
|---------|------|------------|--------|--------|
| debian  | Debian | debootstrap | ISO | [loaden/mini-rescue](https://github.com/loaden/mini-rescue) |
| arch    | Arch Linux | mkarchiso | ISO | [RouHim/platter-engineer](https://github.com/RouHim/platter-engineer) |
| uki     | Arch Linux | mkosi | EFI executable | [swsnr/rescue-image](https://github.com/swsnr/rescue-image) |
| rescatux | Debian | live-build | ISO | [rescatux/rescatux](https://github.com/rescatux/rescatux) |

## Tools

### Rescapp

GUI rescue wizard (Python3/Qt5) with plugin-based rescue tasks:
GRUB restore, Linux/Windows password reset, UEFI boot management,
filesystem check, disk partitioning, Windows MBR restore.

All GTK dependencies converted to Qt (kdialog, PyQt5 DBus).

## Shared Scripts

- `chroot-rescue.sh` -- Mount and chroot into an installed system (LUKS support)
- `detect-disks.sh` -- Display disk layout, LUKS, LVM, and EFI info
- `grub-restore.sh` -- Restore GRUB bootloader to MBR/EFI
- `password-reset.sh` -- Reset a Linux user's password from rescue
- `uefi-repair.sh` -- Check and repair UEFI boot entries

## Building

```bash
make help          # Show all targets
make adapt INPUT=naked.iso  # Layer recovery onto naked ISO
make bootloaders   # Package Debian bootloaders
make debian        # Build Debian rescue ISO
make arch          # Build Arch rescue ISO
make uki           # Build UKI rescue EFI image
make rescatux      # Build Rescatux ISO
make clean         # Remove build artifacts
```
